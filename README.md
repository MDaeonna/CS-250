1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program starts with actively engaging with users to gather detailed insights into their requirements, pain points, and desired outcomes. Creating "user stories" helps with this process by translating these insights into concise, actionable narratives that outline what users need from the product, why they need it, and how it will benefit them. This method ensures that developers have a clear, user-centered framework to guide the development process, ensuring the final product is aligned with actual user expectations and improves overall satisfaction.
2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   When approaching program development, it's essential to start with a clear understanding of user requirements and business objectives, followed by iterative planning and continuous feedback cycles to refine and adjust the program as it evolves. Incorporating Agile processes into your development work can enhance adaptability and responsiveness to change, making your projects more aligned with user needs and market demands. Key Agile practices to adopt include daily stand-ups for team coordination, sprint planning for setting short-term goals, and retrospectives to reflect on what worked and what can be improved. Additionally, employing user stories and maintaining a prioritized backlog ensures that the development team remains focused on delivering value to users consistently and efficiently.
3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   Being a good team member in software development means actively collaborating with your colleagues, contributing positively to problem-solving and project progress while maintaining open communication and mutual respect. It also involves being receptive to feedback, willing to learn and adapt, and committed to the shared goals and success of the team.
